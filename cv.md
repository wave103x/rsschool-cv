3. My goal is to to master a profession. My passion is to realize own ideas into working projects. I have some knowledge and practice in design so I need skills to implement it at code.
I resort asking help in a pinch, prefer to find information by myself commonly. In working at a team I appreciate calmness, proffesional approach, mutual understanding and respect. 
4. I'm tasting C, JavaSctipt and Git.

```
void digitize(uintmax_t n, uint8_t digits[], size_t *length_out)
{
    if (n == 0)
    {
        *length_out = 1;
        digits[0] = 0;
    }
    else
    {
        uintmax_t tmp = n;
        int i = 0;
        while (tmp >= 1)
        {
            tmp /= 10;
            i++;
        }
        *length_out = i;

        for (uintmax_t j = 0; j < i; j++)
        {
            digits[j] = n % 10;
            n = (n - n % 10) / 10;
        }
    }
}
